    <p id="finalDescription" class="description goals">You are at the final step.
      You have written your goals and organized them depending on their priority.
      Now you can take a look once more, go through all of them again to assure yourself this is the correct order
      of your dreams.
      <br/>
      You may still make some changes and drag goals between any of those boxes. Remember, this is all for you to
      help you make best choices.
      To prioritize your dreams that way, so you would never regret you did something easy and simple rather than
      something great you always wanted to do.<br/>
      And once you prioritize your dreams then simply DO THEM. And check this great video:
